        <p>
          I am a career-changer transitioning into the tech field with a focus on Cybersecurity and IT, not out of hype or idealism, but because it aligns strongly with how I think, learn, and solve problems. I am highly analytical, pick up technical systems quickly, and work well in structured, rule-based environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          My background includes nearly 20 years of experience across various industries and running a small art business, where I developed strong skills in problem-solving, communication, time management, and working with technology-driven workflows. These skills translate directly into technical roles involving troubleshooting, investigation, and operational support.
        </p>

        <p>
          I approach cybersecurity as a practical technical discipline: learning the tools, understanding systems at a fundamental level, and applying structured thinking to real-world problems. I am focused on building concrete, usable skills in operating systems, networking, and security operations.
